# Auto-mpg-Model-Prediction
1. Created models to predict fuel efficiency based on 9 mechanical parameters like mpg, cylinders, displacement,  horsepower, etc by using machine learning classification algorithms.
2. Classified the fuel economy of automobiles in 5 categories based on provided 'mpg' data, and shows in which category the model described by input parameters should lie, by using training sets of 6 data inputs and generating 1 output.
